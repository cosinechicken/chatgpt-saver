<p>user: write a python script to convert a text file to html, with code samples (denoted by 3 `'s) formatted properly.</p>
<p>assistant: Certainly, here's an example Python script that reads in a text file, formats any code samples denoted by triple backticks (
```) properly, and outputs the resulting HTML to a separate file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import re

# Open the input and output files
with open('input.txt', 'r') as fin:
    with open('output.html', 'w') as fout:
        # Write the HTML header
        fout.write('&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;My Text File in HTML&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;')
        # Loop through each line in the input file
        for line in fin:
            # Replace triple backticks with &lt;pre&gt; tags
            line = re.sub(r'
```.*\n', '&lt;pre&gt;', line)
            # Replace the closing triple backticks with &lt;/pre&gt;
            line = re.sub(r'
```', '&lt;/pre&gt;', line)
            # Write the updated line to the output file
            fout.write(line)
        # Write the HTML footer
        fout.write('&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;')

</code></pre>
<p>To use this script, simply replace "input.txt" with the name of your input text file and "output.html" with the name you'd like to give the output HTML file. The resulting HTML file will have all code samples properly formatted inside <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags.</p>
